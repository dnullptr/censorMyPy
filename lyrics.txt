I don't wanna wake up
I want you spread out on the sheets
Said pussy so good
Uh, pussy so sweet, oh

I don't wanna wake up
I want it flowin' through my streams
Gettin' me hot
Under my feet
I don't wanna wake up

Please don't wake me up, I feel it creepin' (yeah)
Controllin' how you movin', lucid dreamin' (dreams)
Always on the side of different seasons
Yeah, yeah

Took the beltway down to your hood (it's lit)
Say you was in the crowd, I never looked
Lookin' back how things came back around
Guess I was hooked
Burn the bread and then we burn the town
We both was cooked, yeah

Nah
Nah, please don't wake me up, feel like I'm dreamin'
Any Given Sunday, you can get it, Willie Beamen
I can make your Mondays even better like the weekend (yeah)
That's my Coco, I'm her Ice-T (Coco, yeah, yeah)
Bend her over for some pipin' (it's lit)
Bust a cloud, shoot the lightnin' (pop it)
Pop it now, no, we can't sleep (sleep)

I don't wanna wake up (yeah)
Want you spread out on the sheets (it's lit)
Say: Pussy so good (pop it)
Oh, pussy so sweet (yeah)

When I wake up (yeah, yeah)
Want a drop top on the beach (straight up)
Gettin' me hot, yeah (yeah)
Under my feet
When I wake up

You decide if I live or die
When you're close, I'm alive, I can feel the sky
I just want your body close to me, oh
And if I OD
I'll be alone with no heartbeat
I hope they kill us with a ghost in the Lambo'
And the doors goin' up, suicide

I don't wanna wake up (I don't wanna wake up)
I want you spread out on the sheets (want you spread out on the sheets)
'Cause that pussy so good (pussy so good), yeah
Girl, that pussy so sweet (so sweet)

I don't wanna wake up (I don't wanna wake up)
I want it flowin' through my streams (want it flowin' through my streams)
Hah, gettin' me hot (gettin' me hot)
Oh, under my feet (my feet)
I don't wanna wake up (yeah)
